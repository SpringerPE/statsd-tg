About
━━━━━

  statsd-tg is a traffic generator for StatsD. It generates dummy traffic that
  can be used to stress-test / benchmark StatsD implementations and possibly
  perform profiling.

Install
-------

  Here is the installation on ubuntu:

  1) sudo ap-get install autoconf automake intltool
  2) git clone the statsd-tg repository
  3) move inside the statsd-tg folder and create the po folder: mkdir po
  4) aclocal
  5) autoheader
  6) intltoolize --automake --copy --force
  7) automake --add-missing --copy
  8) autoconf
  9) ./configure
  10) make
  11) sudo make install


Operation
━━━━━━━━━

  statsd-tg generates a set of dummy counters, timers, gauges and sets. The
  number of each type of event can be configured using command line switches.
  It then randomly triggers these events using a PRNG which distributes these
  events uniformly. This means that if you configure 50 counters, 30 timers,
  15 gauges and 5 sets, counters should make up aproximately half of the
  generated traffic, timers 30%, gauges 15% and sets 5%.
